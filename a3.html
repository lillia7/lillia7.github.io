      <p>The schematic used to create the LED circuit. Calculations used to find
        the correct resistors to use for each LED color and photoresistor. A 220 ohm resistor is used
        on the photoresistor because this resistors is used to ground both red and blue LEDs. An additional
        10 ohm resistor is used on the RGB red LED to ground the LED and allow for more light from the blue LED.
        The calculations above also show the potential values at the voltage divider based on a bright room or dark room.

      <p>Here is the finished working product! In the picture and GIF above, there are 2 LEDs (red and purple)
        using a 220 ohm resistor and a photoresistor. Each LED blinks depending on the light in the environment. 
        In this case, when it is at a normal light level (room light) the red LED is on. When there is an excessive
        amount of light, the purple LED turns on.

        <li>In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.</li>
        <img src="A3_Q1.jpg"/>
        <p>As you can see, in both scenarios, the voltage at the output varies with the resistance of the variable resistor (photoresistor),
            and the circuit functions as a voltage divider. The choice of which resistor is variable depends on the desired behavior and the 
            physical characteristics of the components used. With that being said, the variable resistor could be either R1 or R2 (backed by calculations).

        <li>Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</li>

        <li>AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.</li>
        <dd>- If you had a 10-bit PWM resolution and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) instead of the standard 8-bit and 10-bit, respectively, 
            you would need to adjust the parameters used in the map() function in your code.

            The standard map() function in Arduino for a 10-bit ADC and an 8-bit PWM is as follows:
            <pre>
                output = map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
            </pre>
            In this code, sensorValue is assumed to be in the range of 0 to 1023 (10-bit ADC), and the desired output range is 0 to 255 (8-bit PWM).

            If you had a 16-bit ADC and a 10-bit PWM, you would adjust the map() function like this:
            <pre>
                output = map(sensorValue, 0, 65535, 0, 1023);
            </pre>
            Here, the range for sensorValue is now 0 to 65535 (16-bit ADC), and the desired output range is 0 to 1023 (10-bit PWM).

            In summary, to adapt the map() function to different bit resolutions, you need to update the upper bounds of the current range 
            (1023 or 255) based on the number of bits in your ADC or PWM.
