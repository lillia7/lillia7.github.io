            <h2>Technical Implementation!</h2>
            <p>
                To create this LED project, I used a photoresistor (for the automation aspect of the LED strips - turning on in the dark) and an IR remote and receiver (which allows for manual control of the LED strip and switching lighting modes) as the inputs. 
                Using a transistor connected to pin 6 (which allows control of the LED strip via computer and code) as the output.
                I connected all of the components to on a breadboard (pictured below), and began coding via Arduino.

            <p>
                Using a 10k resistor for the photoresistor because a voltage divider is needed to make the voltage drop measurable so that the amount of light the photoresistor receives can be determined. 
                The current used by the LED strip (8.75 A) is less than the max current that the transistor can handle (32A), indicating that the transistor is not being pushed to its maximum capacity which makes it reliable to use with the LED strip.

            <h2>Firmware!</h2>
            <p>
                One of the biggest challenges I had with the technical aspect of the LED strip included calibration, I had initially set up my transistor to turn the LED on and off based on a set value of light the photoresistor takes in.
                This caused the LED strip to flicker and not work under different lighting environments during testing. To combat this issue, I used Arduino's callibration example code to automatically identify maximum and minimum sensor 
                values and turn the LED strip on and off accordingly. Another issue I ran into was using the IR remote, due to the remote buttons having unique codes and the library updating the commands to these codes, I couldn't find
                the command codes for the buttons I wanted to use. To solve this issue, I used a simple code from Circuit Tutorials on IR remotes that read each button input and tranlated each button into a command code to use and call in my own code.
