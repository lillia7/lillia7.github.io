      <p>The schematic used to create the LED circuit. Calculations used to find
        the correct resistors to use for each LED color and buttons. A 10k resistor is used
        on the button because this resistors allows the voltage of the button to be pulled down to ground.

      <p>Here is the finished working product! In the picture and GIF above, there are 2 LEDs (red and green)
        using different resistors according to the calculations above. Each LED blinks or fades independently 
        and is powered by two different buttons.

    <h2>Questions!</h2>
    <div class="section4">
      <ol> 
        <li>Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led,255).</li>
        <img src="A2_Q1.jpg"/>
        <br>
        <li>Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?</li>
        <dd>- Approximately 120000 hours. This was calculated by finding the power used by the LED (0.036W). The I(average) = 0.01A (due to the fading LED). </dd>
