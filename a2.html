      <p>Here is the finished working product! In the picture and GIF above, there are 2 LEDs (red and green)
        using different resistors according to the calculations above. Each LED blinks or fades independently 
        and is powered by two different buttons.

    <h2>Questions!</h2>
    <div class="section4">
      <ol> 
        <li>Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</li>
        <img src="A1_ledgraph.jpg"/>
        <br>
        <li>How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</li>
        <dd>- 20 LEDs which is 1 LED per pin, with the current per pin being 20mA and there being 20 LEDs, it would draw about 0.4 amperes.</dd>
        <br>
        <li>How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
        </li>
        <dd>- 10 milliseconds</dd>
